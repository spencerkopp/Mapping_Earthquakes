# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a map which contains three layers of data, as well as three different possible styles. Three styles of map are present utilizing the mapbox API including: streets-v11, satellite-streets-v11, and navigation-day-v1. Three layers are present on the map including: all earthquakes over the past 7 days, tectonic plate boundries, and major earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.
